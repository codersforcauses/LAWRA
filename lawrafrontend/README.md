# LAWRA Front-End

> A chatbot that will help
CLC clients with contacting, and receiving service from the correct legal department to improve the quality and
efficiency of peopleâ€™s interactions with CLCs.

## Build Setup

* Make sure you have node v12 or higher and npm/yarn installed.
* If you're working on windows, I would recommend you use Git-bash for your Git needs and as the main terminal for this project. Make sure that you have configured Git to use `LF` as your line endings and not `CRLF` which is default on windows.
* Make sure you cd in this directory `/lawrafrontend` and you're not in the root directory.

### For yarn:

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:1234
$ yarn start

# build for production
$ yarn build
```

### For npm:

``` bash
